# Semi-Supervised Regression Ensemble Learning forMultivariate Multi-Step Time Series Forecasting

Training Deep Learning (DL) models with missing labels is a challenge in diverse engineeringapplications.  Semi-supervised learning approaches have been proposed to try to address thisproblem, but their performance is affected with Massive Proportion of Missing Labels (MPML).This  paper  presents  a  semi-supervised  regression  ensemble  learning  framework  to  train  DLmodels  with  MPML  for  Multivariate  Multi-Step  Time  Series  Forecasting.    First,  a  set  ofsamples  of  the  possible  interpolation  of  the  missing  outputs  are  generated  by  the  GaussianProcesses Regression (GPR) based in the domain knowledge.  Second,  the ensemble learningis performed varying the training data with the combination between observed inputs featuresand the obtained samples set (interpolated labels) from GPR. The obtained datasets are usedto train different DL models and the outputs of them are combined to compute the uncertainty(confidence interval) in the forecast.  We evaluated our approach with the development of a soft-sensor with two real datasets (one with MPML) to forecast the biomass of Adeno- AssociatedVirus  production  in  bioreactors.   Our  experimental  results  demonstrate  the  potential  of  theframework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated forecasts in a realcase that would be extremely difficult to train a DL model due to MPML.
